# Backend vs Frontend

Frontend is everything the user interacts with directly: screens, buttons, forms, pages.
Typical technologies: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Angular.

Backend is everything happening behind the scenes on the server.
It processes logic, authentication and communicates with the database.
Typical technologies: Java, .NET, Node.js, Python.

How they work together:
User clicks a button → Frontend sends a request → Backend processes → Database returns data → Frontend displays it.

Example:
When a user logs into an application:
Frontend shows the login form.
Backend verifies the username and password.
Database stores the user account.
The response is sent back and the user is logged in.

Why this matters in recruitment:
Frontend developers focus on UI and user interaction.
Backend developers focus on business logic, performance and data processing.
