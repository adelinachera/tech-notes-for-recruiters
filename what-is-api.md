# What is an API

An API (Application Programming Interface) is a way for two software systems to communicate with each other.

In simple terms:
The frontend (what the user sees) needs data.
The backend (server + database) holds the data.
The API is the messenger between them.

Example:
A mobile banking app does not store your money locally.
When you open the app and see your balance, the app asks a server:
"Give me the account balance for this user."

That request goes through an API.

Common things developers mention:
- endpoints
- GET / POST requests
- authentication tokens
- status codes (200, 401, 404, 500)

Why this matters in recruitment:
Many backend roles (Java, .NET, Node.js) are mainly about building and maintaining APIs.
