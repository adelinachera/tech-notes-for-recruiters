# Tech Notes for Recruiters

This repository contains simple explanations of technical concepts I encounter while recruiting software engineers and technical specialists.

The goal is to better understand developer discussions, job requirements and technical interviews.

## Topics
- What is an API
- Backend vs Frontend
- What a database actually does
- What Git is used for
- Microservices vs Monolith

These notes are written from a non-developer perspective, focused on practical understanding rather than theory.
